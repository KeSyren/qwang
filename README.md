It is a good place to share your solutions and techniques of Leetcode problem. I categorize these problems based on their data structure,
for instance, binary tree problems, stack problems and etc. 

Give myself some advices.
1. Use the book <<Introduction to Algorithm>> as the handbook. 
2. First, try your intuitive way to solve the problem;
3. Then, try to use the techniques to optimize the solution;
4. Finally, summarize formulized procedure for some problems, like recursive function, dynamic programming.
