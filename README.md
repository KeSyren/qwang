It is a good place to share your solutions and techniques of Leetcode problems. I categorize these problems based on their data structure,
for instance, binary tree problems, stack problems and etc. 

## Give myself some advices.
<p> 1. Use the book "Introduction to Algorithm" as the handbook. 
<p>2. First, try your intuitive way to solve the problem;
<p>3. Then, try to use the techniques to optimize the solution;
<p>4. Finally, summarize formulized procedure for some problems, like recursive function, dynamic programming.
