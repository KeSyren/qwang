create an empty stack S
initialize current node as root
push the current node to S and set current = current->left until 
if current is None and stack is not empty then
  a. pop the top item form stack
  b. print the poped item, set curren = popped_item->right
  c. go to step 3.
If current is None and stack is empty then we are done.

class Node:
  def __init__(self, data):
    self.data = data
    self.left = None
    self.right = None
    
   def inOrder(root):
   
      current = root
      stack = []
      done = 0
      
      while True:
        if current is not None:
          stack.append(current)
          current = current.left
          
         elif(stack):
           current = stack.pop()
           print(current.data, end= " ")
           current = current.right
           
         else:
            break
            
       print()
