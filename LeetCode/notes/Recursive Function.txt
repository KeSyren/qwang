How to write a recursive method/function/procedure

	"four factorial"
	4! = 4*3*2*1=24
	
	public static int fact(int n) {
		if(n == 1 || n == 0) {
			return 1;
		} else {
			int result = fact(n-1);
			return n * result;
		}
	
	}

	1. Write "if".
		There must be at least 2 cses:
		a recursive case(where the method calls itself)
		and a base case(where the method does not)
	2. Handle the simplest case(s). "Base Case"
		Simplest = no recursive call needed (no looping)
	3. Write the recursive call(s).
		On the next simpler input/state             (Maybe store result in a variable)
	4. Assume the recursive call work.			
		Ask yourself: What does it do?
		Ask yourself: How does it help?
